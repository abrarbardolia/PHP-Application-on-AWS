# PHP-Application-on-AWS
Deploying a PHP application on AWS EC2 and using AWS RDS MySQL (Aurora) as the database backend involves several steps.

#Step 1: Launch an EC2 Instance
Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
Click on the "Launch Instance" button.
Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that fits your requirements (e.g., Amazon Linux 2, Ubuntu Server).
Select an instance type, configure instance details, add storage, and configure security groups and key pairs.
Review and launch the instance.

#Connect to Your EC2 Instance using (putty if you have windows)

#Step 3: Install and Configure PHP on EC2
sudo yum update (for Amazon Linux) or sudo apt update (for Ubuntu)
#Install PHP and necessary dependencies:
sudo yum install php (for Amazon Linux) or sudo apt install php (for Ubuntu)

#Step 4: Install and Configure Web Server (e.g., Apache)
sudo yum install httpd (for Amazon Linux) or sudo apt install apache2 (for Ubuntu)
#Start and enable Apache:
sudo systemctl start httpd (or apache2 for Ubuntu)
sudo systemctl enable httpd (or apache2 for Ubuntu)
#Configure Apache to serve your PHP application by placing your code in the appropriate document root (e.g., /var/www/html for Apache)
Configure Apache to serve your PHP application by placing your code in the appropriate document root (e.g., /var/www/html for Apache).

Step 5: Set Up and Connect to RDS Aurora

Log in to your AWS Management Console.
Navigate to the RDS dashboard.
Click on "Create Database" and choose "Amazon Aurora."
Configure the database instance, including security groups and database credentials.
Launch the RDS Aurora instance.
Step 6: Configure Your PHP Application to Connect to RDS Aurora

Update your PHP application's database connection settings to point to the RDS Aurora instance. This typically involves modifying a configuration file or environment variables.
Step 7: Test Your Setup

Access your PHP application via a web browser using the EC2 instance's public IP or domain name.
Ensure that your application can connect to the RDS Aurora database and perform necessary database operations.
Step 8: Set Up DNS and Domain Name (Optional)

If you want to use a custom domain name, configure DNS settings (e.g., Route 53) to point to your EC2 instance's IP address.
Step 9: Secure Your Environment

Configure security groups and network ACLs to restrict access to your EC2 instance and RDS Aurora database.
Enable SSL for your RDS Aurora instance to encrypt data in transit.
Step 10: Back Up Your Environment

Implement regular backups for both your EC2 instance and RDS Aurora database to ensure data durability and recovery options.
Step 11: Monitor and Scale

Implement monitoring solutions like Amazon CloudWatch to track the performance of your EC2 instance and RDS Aurora.
Consider scaling your environment as needed by adding more EC2 instances or upgrading your RDS Aurora instance.
This guide provides a broad overview of deploying a PHP application on AWS EC2 and using AWS RDS Aurora as the database. The specifics of your application and requirements may necessitate additional configuration and customization. Be sure to follow best practices for security, performance, and cost optimization as you work through these steps.
